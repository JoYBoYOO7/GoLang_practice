# GoLang Practice Repository

Welcome to my Go (GoLang) practice repository! This space is dedicated to exploring and mastering the fundamental concepts of the Go programming language through hands-on examples.

## üöÄ Topics Covered

This repository contains code examples for the following Go concepts. Each file is a self-contained demonstration of a specific feature.

| Topic         | File                                   | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arrays**    | [`Arrays/array.go`](./Arrays/array.go) | Covers fixed-size array declaration, initialization, iteration, and multi-dimensional arrays.                               |
| **Slices**    | `Slices/slice.go`                      | Explores dynamically-sized slices, including creation, appending, slicing, length/capacity, and copying.                    |
| **Constants** | `Constant/constants.go`                | Demonstrates constant declaration, typed vs. untyped constants, constant expressions, and the `iota` enumerator.            |
| **If-Else**   | `ifelse/ifelse.go`                     | Shows conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.                                                       |
| **For Loops** | `for/for.go`                           | Details the various forms of Go's only looping construct: the `for` loop (classic, while-style, infinite, and `for-range`). |
| **Switch**    | `switch/switch.go`                     | Illustrates the power of the `switch` statement, including multi-case, expressionless, and type switches.                   |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

To run any of the practice files, navigate to the root directory of this project in your terminal and use the `go run` command.

### Syntax

go run <directory_name>/<filename>.go
```

### Examples

To run the slice practice file:

```bash
go run Slices/slice.go
```

To run the switch statement practice file:

```bash
go run switch/switch.go
```

This repository is for personal learning and is a work in progress. New concepts and examples will be added as my journey with Go continues.
